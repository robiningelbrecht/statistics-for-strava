## üìö Wiki

Read [the wiki](https://github.com/robiningelbrecht/strava-statistics/wiki) before opening new issues. The question you have might be answered over there.

## ü™Ñ Prerequisites

You'll need a `Strava client ID`, `Strava client Secret` and a `refresh token`

* Navigate to your [Strava API settings page](https://www.strava.com/settings/api).
  Copy the `client ID` and `client secret`
* Next you need to obtain a `Strava API refresh token`. 
    * Navigate to https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/#d-how-to-authenticate
      and scroll down to "_For demonstration purposes only, here is how to reproduce the graph above with cURL:_"
    * Follow the 11 steps explained there
    * Make sure you change the `&scope=read` to `&scope=activity:read_all` to make sure your refresh token has access to all activities

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation 

> [!NOTE]
> To run this application, you'll need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Start off by showing some ‚ù§Ô∏è and give this repo a star. Then from your command line:

```bash
# Create a new directory
> mkdir strava-statistics
> cd strava-statistics

# Create docker-compose.yml and copy the example contents into it
> touch docker-compose.yml
> nano docker-compose.yml

# Create .env and copy the example contents into it. Configure as you like
> touch .env
> nano .env
```

### docker-compose.yml

```yml
services:
  app:
    image: robiningelbrecht/strava-statistics:latest
    volumes:
      - ./build:/var/www/build
      - ./storage/database:/var/www/storage/database
      - ./storage/files:/var/www/storage/files
    env_file: ./.env
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
```

### .env

```bash
# The URL on which the app will be hosted. This URL will be used in the manifest file. 
# This will allow you to install the web app as a native app on your device.
MANIFEST_APP_URL=http://localhost:8081/
# The client id of your Strava app.
STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
# The client secret of your Strava app.
STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
# The refresh of your Strava app.
STRAVA_REFRESH_TOKEN=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN
# Strava API has rate limits (https://github.com/robiningelbrecht/strava-statistics/wiki),
# to make sure we don't hit the rate limit, we want to cap the number of new activities processed
# per import. Considering there's a 1000 request per day limit and importing one new activity can
# take up to 3 API calls, 250 should be a safe number.
NUMBER_OF_NEW_ACTIVITIES_TO_PROCESS_PER_IMPORT=250
# The schedule to periodically run the import and HTML builds. Leave empty to disable periodic imports.
# The default schedule runs once a day at 04:05. If you do not know what cron expressions are, please leave this unchanged
# Make sure you don't run the imports too much to avoid hitting the Strava API rate limit. Once a day should be enough.
IMPORT_AND_BUILD_SCHEDULE="5 4 * * *"

### Importing challenges and trophies

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only visible challenges on your public profile can be imported. Please make sure that your profile is public,
> otherwise the app won't be able to import them

#### Importing complete history

Strava does not allow to fetch a complete history of your completed challenges and trophies.
There's a little workaround if you'd still like to import these:
* Navigate to https://www.strava.com/athletes/[YOUR_ATHLETE_ID]/trophy-case
* Open the page's source code and copy everything
  ![Trophy case source code](public/assets/images/readme/trophy-case-source-code.png)
* Make sure you save the source code to the file `./storage/files/strava-challenge-history.html`
* On the next import, all your challenges will be imported

## ‚ö°Ô∏èImport and build statistics

```bash
docker compose exec app bin/console app:strava:import-data
docker compose exec app bin/console app:strava:build-files
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Locales and translations

If you want to see a new locale added, please  [open a new issue](https://github.com/robiningelbrecht/strava-statistics/issues/new/choose). 
Only do this if you are willing to help on the actual translation üôÉ.
