## 📚 Wiki

Read [the wiki](https://github.com/robiningelbrecht/statistics-for-strava/wiki) before opening new issues. The question you have might be answered over there.

## 🪄 Prerequisites

You'll need a `Strava client ID` and `Strava client Secret`

* Navigate to your [Strava API settings page](https://www.strava.com/settings/api).
* Copy the `client ID` and `client secret`, you'll need these during the [installation](#%EF%B8%8F-installation)
* Make sure the `Authorization App Domain` is set to the url you will host your app on. By default this should be `http://localhost:8080`

## 🛠️ Installation 

> [!NOTE]
> To run this application, you'll need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Start off by showing some ❤️ and give this repo a star. Then from your command line:

```bash
# Create a new directory
> mkdir statistics-for-strava
> cd statistics-for-strava

# Create docker-compose.yml and copy the example contents into it
> touch docker-compose.yml
> nano docker-compose.yml

# Create .env and copy the example contents into it. Configure as you see fit
> touch .env
> nano .env

# Create config.yaml and copy the example contents into it. Configure as you see fit
> touch config/config.yaml
> nano config/config.yaml
```

### docker-compose.yml

```yml

  app:
    image: robiningelbrecht/strava-statistics:latest
    container_name: statistics-for-strava
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:

### Running the Application

To run the application run the following command:

```bash
> docker compose up
```

The docker container is now running; navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` to access the app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to edit the `.env` file to include your `Strava client ID` and `Strava client Secret`

### Obtaining a Strava refresh token

The first time you launch the app, you will need to obtain a `Strava refresh token`.
The app needs this token to be able to access your data and import it into your local database.

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/. 
You should see this page—just follow the steps to complete the setup.

![Strava Authorization](public/assets/images/readme/strava-oauth.png)

### Importing challenges and trophies

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only visible challenges on your public profile can be imported. Please make sure that your profile is public,
> otherwise the app won't be able to import them

#### Importing complete history

Strava does not allow to fetch a complete history of your completed challenges and trophies.
There's a little workaround if you'd still like to import these:
* Navigate to https://www.strava.com/athletes/[YOUR_ATHLETE_ID]/trophy-case
* Open the page's source code and copy everything
  ![Trophy case source code](public/assets/images/readme/trophy-case-source-code.png)
* Make sure you save the source code to the file `./storage/files/strava-challenge-history.html`
* On the next import, all your challenges will be imported

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure before you save the source code, your Strava account is set to be translated in English.
> The app can only handle this export in English for now.

## ⚡️Import and build statistics

```bash
docker compose exec app bin/console app:strava:import-data
docker compose exec app bin/console app:strava:build-files
```

## 🗺️ Locales and translations

Currently, the app is translated to:

* 🇬🇧 English
* 🇫🇷 French (thanks to [@llaumgui](https://github.com/llaumgui) and [@Ahmosys](https://github.com/llaumgui))
* 🇩🇪 German (thanks to [@daydreamer77](https://github.com/daydreamer77))
* 🇧🇪 Dutch
* 🇵🇹 Portuguese (thanks to [@jcnmsg](https://github.com/jcnmsg) & [@davisenra](https://github.com/davisenra))
* 🇨🇳 Simplified Chinese (thanks to [@c0j0s](https://github.com/c0j0s))

If you want to see a new locale added, please  [open a new issue](https://github.com/robiningelbrecht/statistics-for-strava/issues/new?template=translations-and-localisation.md). 
Only do this if you are willing to help on the actual translation 🙃.

## 💡 Feature request?

For any feedback, help or feature requests, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/robiningelbrecht/statistics-for-strava/issues/new/choose). 
Before you do, please read [the wiki](https://github.com/robiningelbrecht/statistics-for-strava/wiki). The question you have might be answered over there.

## 🛠️ Local setup

Run the following commands to setup the project on your local machine

```bash
> git clone git@github.com:your-name/your-fork.git
> make composer arg="install --no-scripts"
