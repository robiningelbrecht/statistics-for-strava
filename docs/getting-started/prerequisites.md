# Prerequisites

Since this app is called <i>Statistics for Strava</i>, it obviously requires a Strava account.
In addition, there are a few other things you'll need to set up before you can start using the app.
Most importantly, you'll need a `Strava client ID` and `Strava client Secret`

* Navigate to your [Strava API settings page](https://www.strava.com/settings/api).
* Copy the `client ID` and `client secret`, you'll need these during the [installation](/getting-started/installation.md)
* Make sure the `Authorization App Domain` is set to the url you will host your app on. Or you can leave it empty if you are running the app locally.
