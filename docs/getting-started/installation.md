# Installation

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to read the <a href="/#/getting-started/prerequisites">prerequisites</a> before you start installing the app.

Start off by showing some :heart: and give this repo a star. Then from your command line:

```bash
# Create a new directory
> mkdir statistics-for-strava
> cd statistics-for-strava

# Create docker-compose.yml and copy the example contents into it
> touch docker-compose.yml
> nano docker-compose.yml

# Create .env and copy the example contents into it. Configure as you see fit
> touch .env
> nano .env

# Create config.yaml and copy the example contents into it. Configure as you see fit
> touch config/config.yaml
> nano config/config.yaml
```

## docker-compose.yml

```yml

  # ⚠️ This container is optional, it is not required to run Statistics for Strava.
  # Its purpose is to handle recurring background tasks, such as:
  #   - Importing and building Strava data
  #   - Sending notifications when gear maintenance is due
  #   - Sending notifications when a new app version becomes available
  #
  # These tasks can be configured in the main configuration file under the `daemon` section:
  #   https://statistics-for-strava-docs.robiningelbrecht.be/#/configuration/main-configuration
  #
  # If you prefer to trigger these tasks manually, you can omit this container entirely.

## .env

<div class="alert important">
    Every time you change the .env file, you need to recreate (for example; docker compose up -d) your container for the changes to take effect (restarting does not update the .env).
</div>

```bash
# The client id of your Strava app.
STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
# The client secret of your Strava app.
STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
# You will need to obtain this token the first time you launch the app. 
# Leave this unchanged for now until the app tells you otherwise.
# Do not use the refresh token displayed on your Strava API settings page, it will not work.
STRAVA_REFRESH_TOKEN=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN_OBTAINED_AFTER_AUTH_FLOW
# Valid timezones can found under TZ Identifier column here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List

# !! IMPORTANT If you want to serve Statistics for Strava from a custom domain (not localhost), 
# uncomment the following lines and configure them accordingly:

# The domain where Statistics for Strava will be available.
# PROXY_HOST=https://your-domain.com
# The port on which the app will be served.
# PROXY_PORT=8080

# Caddy server log level. Available options: DEBUG, INFO, ERROR
# CADDY_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR
```

## config.yaml

### Running the application

To run the application run the following command:

```bash
> docker compose up
```

The docker container is now running; navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` to access the app.

## Obtaining a Strava refresh token

> [!CAUTION]
> **Caution** Do __not__ use the refresh token displayed on your Strava API settings page, it will not work.


The first time you launch the app, you will need to obtain a `Strava refresh token`.
The app needs this token to be able to access your data and import it into your local database.

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/.
You should see this page—just follow the steps to complete the setup.

## Import and build statistics

Once you have successfully authenticated with Strava, you can import your data and build the html files,
after which you can view your statistics.

```bash
> docker compose exec app bin/console app:strava:import-data
> docker compose exec app bin/console app:strava:build-files
```

<div class="alert important">
Everytime you import data, you need to rebuild the HTML files to see the changes.
</div>
