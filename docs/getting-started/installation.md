# Installation

<div class="alert info">
    To run this application, you'll need <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">Docker</a> with <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">docker-compose</a>.
</div>

Start off by showing some :heart: and give this repo a star. Then from your command line:

```bash
# Create a new directory
> mkdir statistics-for-strava
> cd statistics-for-strava

# Create docker-compose.yml and copy the example contents into it
> touch docker-compose.yml
> nano docker-compose.yml

# Create .env and copy the example contents into it. Configure as you see fit
> touch .env
> nano .env

# Create config.yaml and copy the example contents into it. Configure as you see fit
> touch config/config.yaml
> nano config/config.yaml
```

## docker-compose.yml

```yml
services:
  app:
    image: robiningelbrecht/strava-statistics:latest
    container_name: statistics-for-strava
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./config:/var/www/config/app
      - ./build:/var/www/build
      - ./storage/database:/var/www/storage/database
      - ./storage/files:/var/www/storage/files
    env_file: ./.env
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
```

## .env

<div class="alert important">
    Every time you change the .env file, you need to restart your container for the changes to take effect.

### Running the application

To run the application run the following command:

```bash
> docker compose up
```

The docker container is now running; navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` to access the app.

## Obtaining a Strava refresh token

The first time you launch the app, you will need to obtain a `Strava refresh token`.
The app needs this token to be able to access your data and import it into your local database.

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/.
You should see this pageâ€”just follow the steps to complete the setup.

## Import and build statistics

Once you have successfully authenticated with Strava, you can import your data and build the html files,
after which you can view your statistics.

```bash
> docker compose exec app bin/console app:strava:import-data
> docker compose exec app bin/console app:strava:build-files
```
