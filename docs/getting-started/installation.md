# Installation

<div class="alert info">
    Make sure to read the <a href="/#/getting-started/prerequisites">prerequisites</a> before you start installing the app.
</div>

Start off by showing some :heart: and give this repo a star. Then from your command line:

```bash
# Create a new directory
> mkdir statistics-for-strava
> cd statistics-for-strava

# Create docker-compose.yml and copy the example contents into it
> touch docker-compose.yml
> nano docker-compose.yml

# Create .env and copy the example contents into it. Configure as you see fit
> touch .env
> nano .env

# Create config.yaml and copy the example contents into it. Configure as you see fit
> touch config/config.yaml
> nano config/config.yaml
```

## docker-compose.yml

```yml
services:
  app:
    image: robiningelbrecht/strava-statistics:latest
    container_name: statistics-for-strava
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./config:/var/www/config/app
      - ./build:/var/www/build
      - ./storage/database:/var/www/storage/database
      - ./storage/files:/var/www/storage/files
    env_file: ./.env
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
```

## .env

<div class="alert important">
    Every time you change the .env file, you need to recreate (for example; docker compose up -d) your container for the changes to take effect (restarting does not update the .env).
</div>

```bash
# The client id of your Strava app.
STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
# The client secret of your Strava app.
STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
# You will need to obtain this token the first time you launch the app. 
# Leave this unchanged for now until the app tells you otherwise.
# Do not use the refresh token displayed on your Strava API settings page, it will not work.
STRAVA_REFRESH_TOKEN=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN_OBTAINED_AFTER_AUTH_FLOW
# Valid timezones can found under TZ Identifier column here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List
TZ=Etc/GMT

# The UID and GID to create/own files managed by statistics-for-strava
#PUID=
#PGID=
```

## config.yaml

[include](../configuration/config-yaml-example.md ':include')

### Running the application

To run the application run the following command:

```bash
> docker compose up
```

The docker container is now running; navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` to access the app.

## Obtaining a Strava refresh token

<div class="alert danger">
Do <strong>not</strong> use the refresh token displayed on your Strava API settings page, it will not work.
</div>

The first time you launch the app, you will need to obtain a `Strava refresh token`.
The app needs this token to be able to access your data and import it into your local database.

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/.
You should see this pageâ€”just follow the steps to complete the setup.

## Import and build statistics

Once you have successfully authenticated with Strava, you can import your data and build the html files,
after which you can view your statistics.

```bash
> docker compose exec app bin/console app:strava:import-data
> docker compose exec app bin/console app:strava:build-files
```

<div class="alert important">
Everytime you import data, you need to rebuild the HTML files to see the changes.
</div>
