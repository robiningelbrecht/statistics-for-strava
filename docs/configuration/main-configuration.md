## Athlete weight history

The `weightHistory` is meant to represent a history or evolution of your body weight. It is needed to be able to calculate your relative power. Consider following example:

```yml
general:
  athlete:
    weightHistory:
      "2024-11-21": 69.2
      "2023-04-03": 74.6
      "2023-01-01": 70.3
```

* For activities registered between `2023-01-01` and `2023-04-02` the weight `70.3` will be used
* For activities registered between `2023-04-03` and `2024-11-20` the weight `74.6` will be used
* For activities registered on or after `2024-11-21` the weight `69.2` will be used

<div class="alert info">
If you don't care about relative power, you can use <strong>"1970-01-01": YOUR_CURRENT_WEIGHT</strong> as a single entry in the `weightHistory` to set a fixed weight for all activities.
</div>

## Athlete FTP history

The `ftpHistory` is meant to represent a history or evolution of your FTP. It is needed to be able to calculate activity intensity. Consider following example:

```yml
general:
  athlete:
    ftpHistory:
      "2024-11-21": 243
      "2023-04-03": 209
      "2023-01-01": 200
```

* For activities registered between `2023-01-01` and `2023-04-02` the FTP value `200` will be used
* For activities registered between `2023-04-03` and `2024-11-20` the FTP value `209` will be used
* For activities registered on or after `2024-11-21` the FTP value `243` will be used

If you do not know what FTP is, or you don't need it, leave this value empty.

## Athlete heart rate zones

If one default heart rate zone doesnâ€™t quite work for you, you can fine-tune your setup by adding date ranges and sport types. 
This lets you create very specific zones for different scenarios.

```yaml
  athlete:
    heartRateZones:
      # Relative or absolute. 
      # Relative will treat the zone numbers as percentages based on your max heart rate, while absolute will treat them as actual heartbeats per minute.
      # This mode will apply to all heart rate zones you define.
      mode: relative
      # The default zones for all activities.
      # If you have specified date ranges, this one will be used when there's no exact match for the activity date.
      default:
        zone1:
          from: 0
          to: 60
        zone2:
          from: 61
          to: 70
        zone3:
          from: 71
          to: 80
        zone4:
          from: 81
          to: 90
        zone5:
          from: 91
          to: null # Infinity and beyond.
      # You can further refine your zones by specifying date ranges.
      # This works the same way as weight and FTP history: https://statistics-for-strava-docs.robiningelbrecht.be/#/configuration/main-configuration?id=athlete-weight-historys
      dateRanges:
        "2025-01-01": ...
        "2024-11-08": ...
      # You can also override your heart rate zones for specific sport types.    
      # A full list of allowed options is available on https://statistics-for-strava-docs.robiningelbrecht.be/#/configuration/main-configuration?id=supported-sport-types      
      sportTypes:
        GravelRide:
          # The default heart rate zones for all GravelRide activities.
          # If you have specified date ranges, this one will be used when there's no exact match for the activity date.
          default: ...
          dateRanges:
            "2025-01-01": ...
            "2024-11-08": ...
```
