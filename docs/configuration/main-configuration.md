## Athlete weight history

The `weightHistory` is meant to represent a history or evolution of your body weight. It is needed to be able to calculate your relative power. Consider following example:

```yml
general:
  athlete:
    weightHistory:
      "2024-11-21": 69.2
      "2023-04-03": 74.6
      "2023-01-01": 70.3
```

* For activities registered between `2023-01-01` and `2023-04-02` the weight `70.3` will be used
* For activities registered between `2023-04-03` and `2024-11-20` the weight `74.6` will be used
* For activities registered on or after `2024-11-21` the weight `69.2` will be used

<div class="alert warning">
After each change to these values, you need to run the <i>app:strava:import-data</i> command again
</div>

## Athlete FTP history

The `ftpHistory` is meant to represent a history or evolution of your FTP. It is needed to be able to calculate activity intensity. Consider following example:

```yml
general:
  athlete:
    ftpHistory:
      "2024-11-21": 243
      "2023-04-03": 209
      "2023-01-01": 200
```

* For activities registered between `2023-01-01` and `2023-04-02` the FTP value `200` will be used
* For activities registered between `2023-04-03` and `2024-11-20` the FTP value `209` will be used
* For activities registered on or after `2024-11-21` the FTP value `243` will be used

If you do not know what FTP is, or you don't need it, leave this value empty:

<div class="alert warning">
After each change to these values, you need to run the <i>app:strava:import-data</i> command again
</div>
