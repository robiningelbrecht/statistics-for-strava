# Gear maintenance

Keep track of your gear and stay on top of maintenance tasks with our **Gear Maintenance** feature. It allows you to:

- Automatically track gear usage based your Strava activities
- Monitor usage-based or time-based maintenance intervals.
- Visualize components and tasks with custom images.
- Organize everything via a simple YAML configuration.

---

## How It Works

* Every time a Strava activity is synced, the system checks if the activity involves any of your tracked gear.
* It then calculates the usage of each attached component and updates the progress automatically.
* If the Strava activity title contains one of the configured hashtags, the app will reset the maintenance task and counters from the next activity onwards and will start re-tracking from 0 again.

## Setup

* Make sure you referenced the directory where you want to manage your config as a volume

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: robiningelbrecht/strava-statistics:latest
    volumes:
      - ./config:/var/www/config/app
      # ...
      - ./storage/gear-maintenance:/var/www/storage/gear-maintenance
```

* Create a new file `gear-maintenance.yaml` in `./config`

## Example

```yml
# Set to true to enable the gear maintenance feature
enabled: false
# Prefix for the hashtags used in the Strava activity title
hashtagPrefix: 'sfs'
components:
  # Tag to be added to the Strava activity title.
  # Will be combined with the hashtag-prefix and must be unique across all components.
  # Example: #sfs-chain
  - tag: 'chain'
    # Label for the component
    label: 'Some cool chain'
    # Optional reference to an image. Will be used in the UI.
    # The image must be in the same directory as this config file.
    imgSrc: 'chain.png'
    # List of gear ids this component is attached to
    attachedTo:
      - 'gxxxxxxxx'
      - 'gxxxxxxxx'
    # A list of maintenance tasks for this component
    maintenance:
      # Tag to be added to the Strava activity title.
      # Will be combined with the hashtag-prefix and the component tag.
      # Must be unique across all tasks in the component.
      # Example: #sfs-chain-lubed
      - tag: lubed
        # Label for the maintenance task
        label: Lube
        # Interval for the maintenance task
        interval:
          value: 500
          # Possible values:
          # - km (every x km used),
          # - mi (every x miles used),
          # - hours (every x hours used),
          # - days (every x days),
          unit: km
# If you don't want to reference images, set gears to an empty array: `gears: []`       
gears:
  # Optional reference to an image. Will be used in the UI.
  # The image must be located in the `storage/gear-maintenance` volume.
  - gearId: 'gxxxxxxxx'
    imgSrc: 'gear1.png'
```

<div class="alert important">
After each change to these values, you need to run the <i>app:strava:import-data</i> command again for the changes to take effect
</div>

## Components

Each component represents a part of your gear that you want to track maintenance for, such as a chain, cassette, or brake pads.

```yaml
- tag: 'chain'                
  label: 'Some cool chain'     
  imgSrc: 'chain.png'         
  attachedTo:
    - 'g12337767'             
  maintenance:
    - tag: lubed             
      label: Lube          
      interval:
        value: 500
        unit: km       
```

Adding the tag `#sfs-chain-lubed` to your Strava activity title will reset the maintenance task and counters from the next activity onwards.

## Gears

Define your Strava gear and associate images to display in the UI.

```yaml
gears:
  - gearId: 'g12337767'
    imgSrc: 'gear1.png'
```

Make sure the gearId matches your Strava gear, and the image is located in the `gear-maintenance`volume.

## Best Practices

* Keep tag values short and unique across all components and tasks.
* Be consistent with your hashtags
* Group components logically under relevant gear items.
* Choose intuitive labels and meaningful intervals to make maintenance easy.

## Strava gear IDs

To attach components to specific gear in your config, youâ€™ll need the gear ID from Strava. You can find these IDs by clicking the question mark icon in the top-right corner:
