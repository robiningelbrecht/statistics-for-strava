### Running the Application

To run the application run the following command:

```bash
> docker compose up
```

The docker container is now running; navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` to access the app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to edit the `.env` file to include your `Strava client ID` and `Strava client Secret`

### Obtaining a Strava refresh token

The first time you launch the app, you will need to obtain a `Strava refresh token`.
The app needs this token to be able to access your data and import it into your local database.

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/.
You should see this page‚Äîjust follow the steps to complete the setup.
